# 🛍️ Online Retail Customer Segmentation (E-Commerce + Personalization)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes online retail transactions to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior.  
Using **RFM analysis, CLV estimation, anomaly detection, and clustering**, we provide actionable insights for **personalized marketing and customer retention**.

## 🚀 Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- SQL (MySQL for data extraction & queries)
- Excel / Google Sheets (dashboards, slicers, pivot tables)
- GitHub for version control


## 📊 Key Features
- **RFM Scoring** – Recency, Frequency, Monetary segmentation  
- **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Estimation** – Predict long-term value of customers  
- **Anomaly Detection** – Spot unusual purchasing behaviors  
- **Clustering (K-Means)** – Segment customers into groups for personalization  
- **Excel Dashboard** – Interactive charts, slicers, and scenario simulation

## 🔑 Key Insights
- High-value customers (Cluster 1) respond well to **loyalty programs**  
- Medium-value customers (Cluster 2) can be engaged via **discount-based offers**  
- Low-value customers (Cluster 3) show **one-time purchases**, requiring **re-engagement campaigns**  
- Anomaly detection revealed **spike purchases during holidays**  

## 📬 Recommendations
- Implement **personalized email campaigns** by cluster  
- Launch **loyalty rewards** for high CLV customers  
- Monitor anomalies to optimize **inventory planning**
